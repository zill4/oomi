## Testing
To test the resume parser:
1. Upload a resume through the frontend interface
2. Monitor the parsing status in the UI
3. Verify parsed data in the database
4. Check S3 for stored files

### TODO
1. Branding update - There are a lot of similarties to dating and finding a job. Interviewing is kind of like dating, and getting a job is like soft-marriage.
Lot of risk/reward, wasted time and money, and hard feelings on both sides.
2. fix issue with password regex
3. copy/paste doesn't work on mac it seems (cover letter)
4. Simplify the flow when a user creates an account
5. Add resume builder using LaTeX? (maybe)
6. Optimize consideration of using users
7. Chrome extension
